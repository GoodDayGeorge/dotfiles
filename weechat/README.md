WeeChat
=======

My configuration files for the [WeeChat](https://weechat.org/) chat client.

Installation
------------

* Copy `.weechat` to `$HOME/`.

Plugins
-------

I use the following plugins:

* [autosort.py](https://weechat.org/scripts/source/autosort.py.html/) -
  Automatically keeps buffers grouped by server and sorted by name.
* [iset.pl](https://weechat.org/scripts/source/iset.pl.html/) - Interactive
  setting of WeeChat options.
* [vimode.py](https://weechat.org/scripts/source/vimode.py.html/) - Vi-like key
  bindings and commands with normal and insert mode.
* [weechat-notify-send](https://github.com/s3rvac/weechat-notify-send) -
  Notifications.

The following plugins are no longer needed:

* [buffers.pl](https://weechat.org/scripts/source/buffers.pl.html/) - Sidebar
  with a list of buffers. No longer needed [since WeeChat
  1.8](https://weechat.org/files/releasenotes/ReleaseNotes-devel.html#v1.8_buflist_plugin).
